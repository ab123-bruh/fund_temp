# Mina Vista Partners - Research & Development

This repository consists of an internal platform and a portfolio optimization model for the Macro Traders to use for their analysis. 

Mina Vista Partners is currently in the process of creating an internal API for our traders to work with in relation to their current portfolio. This is a place where the code will be stored for now until we are able to further scale up our operations. It is still TBD if the API will end up becoming something avaliable to the public as we continue to develop both the platform and the model that we are working with. Over time, this repository will become top notch for users to enjoy whether they are an end user or a back-end analyst building the code at the moment.
